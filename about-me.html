        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Nathaniel and welcome to my website. I am a sec 3 student who made this website for my coding class project. The reason I chose to make a movie review website as opposed to some other website, is that movies always have and continue to interest me. There is a lot you can see when watching movies, lots of different genres and subgenres for pretty much everyone out there. Currently, I am really into horror movies, as I have always like being scared. There are always some really bad movies for every genre, but horror movies are very well known for not having the best movies. This is true, but when there is a good movie it tends to make massive waves and have a huge cult following. Somme examples of this is The Shinning, The Thing, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th,

        and many others. Some of my hobbies include watching movies (duh), playing videogames and reading. I enjoy the outdoors aswell, we have some property about 2 hours away from montreal, and we go up every summer, as in the winter it is not possible to get there and the only way to get there and go up is by putting all of your equipement on a sled or tabogaan and pulling it up the mountain for about a 1-2 hour hike. Anyway, that's about it for me, hope you enjoy the website and learn all about some movies!
